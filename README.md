# Co2 Emission Project using ML 

This repository contains code and resources for a CO2 Emission Project that predicts CO2 emissions using Machine Learning techniques, particularly Linear Regression. The project aims to understand and predict CO2 emissions based on various input features.

## Overview

The CO2 Emission Project utilizes Machine Learning to predict CO2 emissions based on factors such as vehicle characteristics, engine specifications, and other relevant features. By employing Linear Regression, the project aims to build a predictive model that can estimate CO2 emissions accurately.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijaymakkad/CO2-Emission-Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CO2-Emission-Project
```

3. Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main script to train the Linear Regression model and make predictions:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about vehicles and their corresponding CO2 emissions. It includes features such as vehicle make, model, engine size, fuel type, and more. The dataset is stored in the `data` directory.

## File Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `models/`: Stores trained models.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.
- `main.py`: Main script for training the model and making predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
